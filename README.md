This is a Hands on practise project on Logistic regression.
Project AIM : In this project we are trying to predict the objects(Rock,Mine) in water via using sonar radiation data.
what type of project it is ? : this is a typical binary classification problem in which model have to predict wheather the object is rock or mine.
for this project i selected LogisticRegression model,and loss fuction as accuracy score.

ALL the steps are followed in : https://github.com/khushwantsanwalot/sonar_pred/blob/02fe5ee67ace182680f9772d0102d646759a83a9/sonar_pred.ipynb
